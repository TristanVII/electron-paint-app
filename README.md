# Online Collaborative Paint App


## ElectronJS Application Overview

This application replicates the functionality of MS Paint while introducing a collaborative online feature, allowing users to create rooms for joint drawing sessions.

## How it Works

1. **Go Websocket Server Management:**
   - The Go websocket server handles room creation, user joining, and event transmission.
  
2. **Collaborative Drawing:**
   - Users sharing the same room experience real-time updates on the front-end as strokes are made, fostering a collaborative drawing environment.

*Note: This project is currently a work in progress, with ongoing improvements and enhancements.*
